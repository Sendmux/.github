## Why Sendmux

Email platforms were built for people clicking send, not agents and product workflows that need to send, receive, route, and react to email from code.

Sendmux covers outbound delivery, programmable inboxes, provider routing, delivery monitoring, and workflow automation in the same workspace.

- **Send and receive email.** Send through API or SMTP, receive into programmable mailboxes, and manage product email workflows from the same workspace.
- **Bring your providers.** Connect Gmail, Outlook, SendGrid, Mailgun, Resend, Amazon SES, or any SMTP-compatible provider. Sendmux handles routing, failover, monitoring, and quota guardrails.
- **Parse inbound email for agents.** Incoming email becomes structured JSON, including the subject, body, attachments, headers, and metadata.
- **Monitor delivery.** Delivery logs, bounces, complaints, webhooks, and provider health monitoring show what happened and help teams respond quickly.
